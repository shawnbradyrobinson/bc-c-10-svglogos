/**
 * Inquirer needs to ask the user a series of questions, and then the answers need to call the separate operations
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1) Ask for three characters (else too many characters)
 * 
 * 2) Accepts text color keywords, or hexadecimal color coding..."Do you want to enter color as keyword or hexadecimal?"
 * 
 * 3) Choose a shape 
 * 
 * 4) Accepts shape color keywords...
 * 
 * 5) Writes the file to logo.svg and outputs the text "Generated logo.svg"
 * 
 * Probably a good idea to have a CLI Class like the mini project has 
 * 
 * SHAPE CLASS 
 * 
 * class Shape {
 * 
 * PROPERTIES 
 * whatever dimensions svg needs to make these shapes...the general shape class could start with zeroes for all...
 * METHODS
 * 
 * const textSize = ??? <-- maybe this needs to change depending on the different shapes, or maybe it can be uniform, either way, making it a property and then referring to it later will help out, I believe. 
 * 
 * renderShape(){
 * //polymorphism changes this one depending on the shape 
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * renderTextColor(){
 * //this could stay the same for all shapes
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * renderShapeColor(){
 * //this could stay the same for all shapes 
 * 
 *}
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * }
 * Alright, so there's some basic shape-ness, and then, like with the mini-project, the details are filled in by its children...
